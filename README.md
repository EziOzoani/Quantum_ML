# Why

My original aim was to explore Quantum computing in the financial space, this then shifted to wanting to creaate a quantum recommenender system to illustrate the commercial capabilities of quantum machines.
During my research into quantum programmign I realised that outisee of basic circuit buidling proivded by Qiskit the information needed to build a full Quantum Machine learning circuit was distributed amongst different physics based research publications. These papers 

# Aim

I aim was to provide not only a central location with ilusative and code for how to implemnt a quanutm machien learnign cirucit, I also aimed to provide modualr approach to each step of the quantum machine learning 

- The first and the most important aim is to provide a circuit with all three stages of a quantum machine learning circuit (data encoding, quantum algothim and quanutm machine learning exection) with modular components in an accessible form. This enables futuredevelopment on this work to be easy and approachable, particularly for quantumenthusiasts and those more literate in software development than in quantum physics. To do so, the necessary python code is presented in a technical manner where detailedknowledge of quantum physics would not be necessary. However, the basic quantumtheoretical knowledge will be explained in a concise and austere style

  
 - For the algorithm stage of the circuit, a full quantum machine learning implementationof k-Nearest Neighbour is detailed based on the descriptions detailed in the work 'Algorithm for k-Nearest Neighbours Classification based on the Metric of Hamming Distance' [Sharma, 2020]. Two variations of Groverâ€™s Search algorithm and QSVMare also explored, these are delivered through illustrative and succinct implementations.
    
 -  In order to run classical data on a quantum circuit, quantumreadable data is required. Existing data encoding methods, both theoretical andimplemented, are dispersed across various research publications. My work presents different methods for data encoding both the circuit design and the code in acentralised location.
 
 -  Finally, bench-marking is performed on the aforementioned quantum machine learningalgorithms and their classical counterparts. In addition to the quantum computer execution, my  work details an external classical quantum based simulator, the JKU simulator, its advantages,current state and the necessary implementation. These measurement techniques allowfor a critical review of the circuit results, for the different circuit components
