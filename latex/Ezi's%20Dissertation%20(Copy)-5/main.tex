\chapter*{Abstract}
Machine learning based techniques have become widespread in recent years, and this has driven further developments in the field. %The use cases and the developments of machine learning increase as the rate of application rises. 
One of these developments is the translation of machine learning algorithms from classical computers to quantum computers. The expansion of quantum hardware accessibility enables more extensive research into the potential speed-up quantum algorithms could provide. This speed-up could potentially play a big role in machine learning, where model training becomes slower as the size of training set grows.

The dispersed nature of the resources and the information required to construct a complete quantum machine learning circuit affects the accessibility of quantum machine learning programming. This dissertation provides a centralised resource or starting point for those acquainted with software development rather than theoretical quantum physics. An introduction to the required quantum background, as well as a modular approach to Quantum k-Nearest Neighbour, Quantum Support Vector Mechanism and Grover's Search algorithm is provided. Additionally, these quantum algorithms are tested in order to analyse and observe their quantum speedup claims.
